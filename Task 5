Task 5 – Advanced Web Attacks using Burp Suite (DVWA)
🎯 Objective
To use Burp Suite for intercepting, analyzing, and modifying HTTP requests, and to perform automated fuzzing/brute-force testing with the Intruder tool on DVWA.

🛠 Tools Used
Kali Linux
Burp Suite Community Edition
Burp Embedded Browser
DVWA application (localhost)

🔎 What is Burp Suite?
Burp Suite is a professional web-application security testing tool.
It is used by security analysts for:
intercepting web traffic
modifying requests and responses
scanning for vulnerabilities
performing automated attacks (Intruder)

🧭 Steps Performed
✔ Step 1 — Launch Burp Suite
Opened Burp Suite Community Edition
Created a Temporary Project
Started Burp with default settings

✔ Step 2 — Open Burp Browser
Opened Proxy → Intercept
Enabled Intercept ON
Clicked Open Browser
DVWA opened through Burp’s internal browser
All traffic automatically passed through Burp proxy.

✔ Step 3 — Access DVWA Login Page
Browsed to:
http://localhost/dvwa/login.php
DVWA login page successfully loaded

✔ Step 4 — Enter Dummy Credentials
Tried logging in with incorrect credentials:
username: admin
password: 123
Burp intercepted the login request

✔ Step 5 — Analyze HTTP Request
Observed in Burp:
POST request
username and password fields
cookies
user-agent
content length
form parameters

✔ Step 6 — Send Request to Intruder
Right-clicked captured request
Selected Send to Intruder
Opened Intruder tab

✔ Step 7 — Configure Attack Positions
Selected attack type:
Sniper / Battering Ram
Selected parameters:
username field
password field

✔ Step 8 — Add Payload List
Examples of payloads used:
admin
password
123456
admin123
test
root

✔ Step 9 — Start Intruder Attack
Clicked Start Attack
Burp automatically sent multiple login attempts

✔ Step 10 — Analyze Intruder Results
Observed key fields:
Status code
Response length
Response time
Different response length indicated valid credentials detected.

🧪 Results & Observations
Successfully intercepted login requests
Username & password parameters were visible
Intruder automated multiple login attempts
Learned how response differences reveal valid logins
Understood how weak credentials are exploited

🔐 Security Learnings
To defend against such attacks, websites should implement:
Strong password policy
Account lockout & rate-limiting
CAPTCHA on login pages
Multi-factor authentication
Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Monitoring & logging of login attempts

✅ Conclusion
Task 5 demonstrated:
Burp Suite configuration
HTTP request interception
Request manipulation
Automated fuzzing/brute force via Intruder
Burp Suite is a powerful tool for both ethical hackers and security testers.
