Task 3 – Web Application Penetration Testing using Burp Suite & DVWA
🎯 Objective
To intercept, analyze, and manipulate HTTP requests using Burp Suite and perform basic web vulnerability testing on DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application).

🛠 Tools Used
Kali Linux
Burp Suite Community Edition
Firefox Browser
DVWA (localhost environment)

🧭 Steps Performed
✔ Step 1 – Launch Burp Suite
Opened Burp Suite from Kali Linux
Selected Temporary Project
Start Burp with default settings

✔ Step 2 – Configure Embedded Browser
Opened Burp’s built-in Chromium browser
Browser traffic automatically routed through Burp

✔ Step 3 – Open DVWA
Accessed:
http://localhost/dvwa
Loaded login page successfully

✔ Step 4 – Turn ON Intercept
In Burp Suite:
Opened Proxy → Intercept
Turned Intercept ON
Browser requests started getting captured

✔ Step 5 – Capture Login Request
Entered dummy credentials on DVWA login page:
username = admin
password = admin
Request intercepted in Burp Suite

✔ Step 6 – Analyze HTTP Request
Observed:
POST method
Login parameters
Cookies
User-Agent
Referrer
Identified possibility of:
Brute-force attack
SQL Injection
Parameter tampering

✔ Step 7 – Send Request to Intruder
Right-clicked captured request
Selected Send to Intruder

✔ Step 8 – Configure Intruder Positions
Chose Sniper/Battering Ram
Set payload positions on:
username
password

✔ Step 9 – Add Payloads
Added list:
admin
password
admin123
root
test

✔ Step 10 – Start Attack
Ran brute-force attack through Intruder
Observed different response lengths
Identified valid credential combination

🧪 Results & Observations
Successfully intercepted login request
Viewed and modified HTTP parameters
Performed basic brute force via Intruder
Understood response length-based detection
Learned how weak credentials are exploited

🔐 Security Learnings
Never use default credentials
Implement account lockout
Use CAPTCHA
Add rate-limiting
Monitor login attempts via logs

✅ Conclusion
Task 3 successfully demonstrated:
Burp Suite configuration
HTTP request/response interception
Vulnerability testing workflow
Basic brute-forcing concepts
DVWA proved how insecure web applications are exploited in real environments.
