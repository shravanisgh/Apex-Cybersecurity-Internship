Task 6 – Web Security Headers & Brute-Force Testing (DVWA)
🎯 Objective
To analyze missing web security headers and perform brute-force login testing in DVWA, understanding how insecure configurations expose web applications to attacks.

🛠 Tools Used
Kali Linux
DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
Web Browser (Firefox/Chromium)
Browser Developer Tools

🔐 What are Web Security Headers?
Web security headers are sent by the server along with HTTP responses.
They help protect against:
XSS attacks
Clickjacking
Content injection
Man-in-the-middle attacks

Examples include:
Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
X-Frame-Options
X-Content-Type-Options
Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
Referrer-Policy

🧭 Steps Performed
✔ Step 1 — Open DVWA
Launched DVWA in the browser
Verified that the web application loads correctly

✔ Step 2 — Open Developer Tools
Pressed F12 / Right-click → Inspect
Opened Network tab

✔ Step 3 — Check Response Headers
Reloaded DVWA page
Selected request from the Network list
Observed missing security headers such as:
Content-Security-Policy
X-Frame-Options
Strict-Transport-Security
This indicates the application is not following secure configuration practices.

✔ Step 4 — Set DVWA Security Level
Navigated to DVWA Security page
Set security level to Low for testing

✔ Step 5 — Open Brute Force Module
Went to Brute Force page in DVWA
Viewed the login form

✔ Step 6 — Failed Login Attempt
Entered incorrect credentials
Login failed, showing invalid username/password

✔ Step 7 — Successful Login Attempt
Used default weak credentials:
username: admin
password: password
Login was successful
Demonstrates how weak passwords enable brute-force attacks.

🧪 Results & Observations
DVWA is missing several important security headers
Application accepts weak credentials
Brute-force attack is possible
Security level Low exposes vulnerabilities deliberately

🔐 Security Recommendations
To secure a real-world web app:
Enforce strong password policies
Add account lockout or rate-limiting
Implement CAPTCHA on login pages
Use HTTPS with HSTS
Configure security headers:
X-Frame-Options
Content-Security-Policy
X-Content-Type-Options
Keep server and framework updated

✅ Conclusion
Task 6 successfully demonstrated:
Security header analysis using browser dev tools
Brute-force vulnerability in DVWA
Impact of weak configuration and passwords
This exercise shows why secure headers and authentication policies are essential in web application security.

🖼 Screenshot Checklist (what I used)
DVWA loaded normally
Developer tools opened
Missing security headers view
DVWA security level set to Low
Brute Force page opened
Failed login attempt
Successful login with default credentials
